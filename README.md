# JuriSight: AI-Powered Legal Assistant for Digital India âš–

JuriSight is a web-based application developed for the *Gen AI Exchange Hackathon*. It's designed to help everyday consumers and small business owners understand complex legal documents, with a special focus on bridging the language and accessibility gap in India.

## Problem Statement

* *Language Barrier*: A significant portion of the Indian population struggles with complex English, the primary language for legal documents, creating a major barrier to comprehension.
* *Low Legal Literacy*: The complexity and cost of legal services mean that a vast majority of citizens cannot afford or access timely legal aid, leaving them vulnerable.
* *Digital Divide*: Access to modern legal technology is heavily concentrated in urban centers, leaving rural and underserved populations with limited resources.

## Solution Impact

* *Simplify & Translate*: Jurisight will simplify complex legal documents and offer translations into regional languages, making them accessible to all.
* *Provide AI-Powered Guidance*: The application will serve as a "first-step" legal assistant, answering user questions and explaining clauses in simple terms.
* *Bridge the Access Gap*: By being a web-based tool, Jurisight aims to bring essential legal technology to rural and semi-urban users, promoting digital inclusion.

## Key Features

* *Multi-Format Document Upload*: Users can easily upload legal documents in various formats like PDF, DOCX, and TXT.
* *"At-a-Glance" Summaries*: Instantly generates a high-level summary of the document, highlighting key parties, dates, and financial figures.
* *Interactive Q&A*: A conversational chat interface, powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, allows users to ask specific questions about their document.
* *Explainable AI (XAI) Module*: To ensure transparency and build trust, every answer is directly tied back to the source clause in the original document.
